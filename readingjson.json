At noon she found a fallen tree and sat on it to eat her lunch. After lunch Sue found an animal trail that led to a quiet spring. She looked into the water and saw small fish swimming. She must remember to tell her grandparents about the little fish in the spring. Sue realized that it was time to start back to her grandparents’ house, but she didn’t know which way to go. Just then she heard rustling in the bushes right behind her. She was frightened and started to run. The noise followed her as she ran. It kept getting closer. All of a sudden something jumped at her!

He wasn’t just going to fly in an airplane. He was going to fly like a hawk. He spent many hours watching hawks fly. They made it look so easy. With their powerful wings they built up speed, then they would glide. It was beautiful and breath-taking watching them ride the air currents. “I am going to fly.” As he climbed to the top of the cliff, his imagination was far ahead of him telling him how exciting it would be. At the top he paused only for a moment; then he dove off the cliff into the air. “This is wonderful! This is better than I had ever imagined!” He soared, he dipped, and rose again, riding the air currents. Flying was better than he had imagined. When Jerry awoke, his parents were standing by the hospital bed. “The doctor said you will be fine. You will have to miss two more weeks of school because of your tonsil operation.” After Jerry’s parents left, he thought a moment, “I really felt like I was flying. I could feel the cool air blowing through my hair. I saw the landscape below me.” Was it a dream or not? If it was a dream, where did he get the brownish hawk feather he was holding?"

The man assumed charge of the woman’s belongings in a most possessive manner. He was short, slender, blonde, and had a rosy complexion. Kay picked up the woman’s handbag from the snow, but the young man snatched it from her almost as if he suspected her of trying to steal it. “Just a minute, please!” exclaimed Kay. “I’m just trying to help this lady. May I ask why you are trying to take charge of her things?” “I am her son!” retorted the young man unpleasantly as he went on hastily collecting the things which had burst from the suitcase.

He leaped up onto the rail and balanced himself there to get a greater elevation; his pipe, striking a rope, was knocked from his mouth. He lunged for it.

He struggled up to the surface and tried to cry for help, but the wash from the speeding yacht slapped him in the face. The salty water in his open mouth gagged and strangled him. Desperately he struck out with strong strokes after the receding lights of the yacht, but he stopped before he had covered fifty feet. He calmed down and assessed his situation. It was not the first time he had been in a tough situation. There was a chance that his cries could be heard by someone aboard the yacht. But the chance was slim and grew much slimmer as the yacht continued on. He shouted with all his might. The lights of the yacht became faint, looking like ever-vanishing fireflies.

Only one thing could help me now, so I prayed earnestly that I’d be allowed to sit under the house and have the entire building collapse on my jaw. Since there was no dentist in Stamps, nor doctor either, for that matter, Momma had dealt with other toothaches. She would try yanking them out with a string tied to the tooth and the other end looped over her fist, as well as pain killers and prayer. In this case the medicine proved inef- fective. There wasn’t enough enamel left to hook a string on, and the prayers were being ignored because some demon was blocking their way. I lived some days and nights in blinding pain, not so much toying with, as seriously considering, the idea of jumping in the well. So Momma decided I had to be taken to a dentist. The nearest dentist was in Mason, twenty miles away, and I was sure that I’d be dead long before we reached half the distance. Momma said we’d go to Dr. Lincoln, and he’d take care of me.

Apollo was always the god of the sun, but later he became patron of music, poetry, mathematics, and medicine. As an adult, Apollo was known for his unparalleled wisdom, but in his youth he was known for his barbarous exploits. Several times he was almost expelled from the company of the gods by Zeus, whom he angered with his youthful folly. One objectionable folly was Apollo’s treatment of a satyr named Marsyas. Marsyas was an excellent musician; Apollo considered this his talent and would allow no rivalry. Hearing Marsyas praised continually, Apollo invited him to a musical contest. The winner was to choose a penalty to which the loser would have to submit, and the Muses were their judges. Marsyas played his melodious flute, and Apollo played his lyre. They played so exquisitely that the Muses could not choose between them, so Apollo suggested that they play their instruments upside down and sing simultaneously. Apollo turned his lyre upside down, played, and chanted a beautiful poem. Because Marsyas could not play his flute upside down and sing at the same time, the despondent satyr was declared the loser. Consequently, Apollo collected the prize. "

They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was immediately captured by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome, stone structure, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills. She had never seen a place for which nature had enhanced more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.

This helped him keep track of where the bird went. He did this with one hawk from each group. The scientist went to a high place to watch the hawks. This took a lot of time and hard work. He discovered that most of the time the hawks caught rabbits. These were large rabbits that would be hard for one hawk to catch. The hawks worked together as a team so that they could catch their prey. Then they all shared the meal. The scientist watched as the hawks would stalk their prey. First, they would fly across a large area. Sometimes the hawks would sit in trees to watch the ground. When the hawks saw a rabbit, they would start following it. When the rabbit slowed down in an open place, the hawks would dive at it. The hawks would wait until the rabbit became tired to make their final dive. These hawks are very good at working as a team.

They turned a stick that twisted a rubber band, fastened it, and then tossed the helicopter into the air. Orville and Wilbur reached to catch it before it fell. The toy helicopter flew several feet across the room. The boys played with it until it broke. Orville had many plans for making money. He learned to make and fly kites, and he made money by selling them to his friends. By the time he was fourteen, he had a printing press and business. Wilbur became interested in the business. In a short time, they published a weekly newspaper. Bicycles became popular in the 1890s. These early bikes were very dangerous and difficult to ride. The front wheel was five feet high. The back wheel was eighteen inches high. A new bicycle was then built with two wheels of equal size, similar to today’s bikes. The brothers rented a shop. They began repairing and selling bicycles. Now they had two businesses. One day, Wilbur saw a photograph of a glider with a man hanging beneath the wings. He showed it to Orville.

They dismissed it for 52 design mistakes, but Darrow knew he had a winning game. With help from a friend, he made sets by hand. These sold at a Philadelphia department store. People loved the game and orders soon started flooding in. Darrow knew he couldn’t keep up the pace. He went to Parker Brothers a second time. This time they accepted the game and quickly began mass production. That first year, 1935, Monopoly was the best-selling game in America. Monopoly made Darrow the first million- aire game designer, freeing him from ever worrying about a job again."

      "text": "At the break of dawn, he rises from the bed that is placed just outside the door to his hut. Dressed only in shorts and sandals, he sets out on his daily prowl of Kenya’s Kora Game Preserve in Eastern Africa. He is looking for lions. George Adamson is not a hunter; on the contrary, his days are spent trying to preserve what few wild lions remain on this part of the African continent. The Kenyan government closed Ad- amson’s lion rehabilitation program after several people at his camp were assaulted by the cats he considers the perfection of ageless beauty and grace. Now he searches for the lions he returned from captivity and for their offspring. They come to him when he calls. He feeds them like pets, and he protects them from poachers. In the late 1950s, when he was a government game warden, Adamson shot a man-eating lioness who had a cub. The story of how he and his wife Joy raised the cub, Elsa, is told in the book and the movie titled Born Free. This story brought the cause of wildlife conservation to the attention of people in many countries around the world. It also raised $600,000 that has been used for a variety of wildlife conservation projects. Since Joy’s death in 1980, Adamson has wandered the lonely landscape of this vast preserve. His long, flowing, golden hair and white beard make him appear like one of the creatures he loves so much—the lion"

      "text": "Pompeii, an ancient city in Southern Italy, was settled in the 8th century B.C. It was overtaken by the Romans in 310 B.C. and became part of the Roman Empire. During its first five hundred years, Pompeii grew from a small farming village to an important trading center. Then in 62 A.D. an earthquake hit the city, leaving it destroyed. The residents of the city began rebuilding, but while they were in the middle of rebuilding the city temple, a more lasting disaster arrived. Mount Vesuvius, a volcano which had been thought extinct, erupted in 79 A.D. covering Pompeii with hot lava. Eye-witnesses watched Mount Vesuvius erupt as bright flames towered in the sky and black smoke covered the sun. Volcanic ash and lava covered the city until almost no buildings were left standing. As the volcanic eruption hit Pompeii, the universe seemed to fight against the city send- ing lightning, earthquakes, and tidal waves. This attack lasted for three days, killing all who had survived the volcano. When the dust settled, 15 feet of smoking debris covered what had once been Pompeii. Pompeii was buried under ashes, stone, and cinders for almost 2,000 years. After the volcano, looters took what they could find from the city, and Pompeii was forgotten until the nineteenth century when the site was rediscovered and excavation began. Much has been learned about the manners and customs of the ancient Romans. Today, visitors can walk through Pompeii and view a city almost 3,000 years old."

      "text": "Earthquakes can be devastating natural disasters. The infamous San Francisco earthquake of 1906 caused over $200-million worth of damage, destroyed almost 30,000 buildings, and killed about 450 persons. In Japan, the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama were leveled by the earthquake of 1923 in which more than 140,000 persons were killed by falling buildings and fires, and over a million people were left homeless—all in 30 seconds. Hundreds of earthquakes occur every year throughout the world. Fortunately, few are as destructive as those described above. The development of an accurate system for predicting 5 earthquakes would lessen the loss of life and property, but at present scientists can only study these phenomena. The study of earthquakes is called seismology. Seismographs, instruments sensitive to ground movement, are used to chart each motion, and the Richter Scale is commonly used to grade each earthquake’s strength on a 1-to-10 scale. It is now known that earthquakes are created by sudden shifts that occur along faults deep in the earth’s crust. According to the Theory of Continental Drift, the earth’s crust consists of about twenty rigid sections, or plates, that are in continuous movement. This movement grinds and presses rocks at the edge of the plates. If the pressure becomes too great, the rocks shift, and the resulting movement sends energy, or seismic waves, to the surface of the earth. Most major earthquakes occur along the edge of the plates, and the most damaging impact occurs at the first surface-point reached by the seismic waves."

      "title": "Beating the Bonk",
      "text": "Bonk describes the symptoms that occur when your body’s carbohydrate stores are used up as a result of sustained exercise. As you exercise, most of the fuel being burned is consumed by your muscles. Both fats and carbohydrates can be used for this process. Fat, stored in fatty tissue, is reduced to free fatty acids which are transported by the blood to the muscles. In contrast, carbohydrates are stored within the muscles as glycogen. During exercise, individual molecules of glycogen are removed and used as energy. Your vital organs also need a continuous supply of fuel. Whether at rest or during exercise, your brain and nervous system depend on blood glucose. The reason why they need glycogen is because the cells of your nervous system don’t store glycogen and can’t use fat. To meet energy requirements, your blood glucose levels must stay at the same level. This job is largely done by your liver, which contains large amounts of glycogen that can be converted to glucose. With the muscles and organs vying for glucose, lengthy exercise can drain the liver. When blood glucose levels become too low to meet the fuel requirement of your central nervous system, you begin to feel tired, irritated, and unhappy. In a word, you bonk. Fortunately, you can remedy the bonk. When your blood glucose levels fall, you can replenish them by eating or drinking something rich in carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are quickly digested into glycogen, which is transported to the liver, muscles, and other organs. Adapted from Nutrition for Cyclists. Rodale Press."

      "text": "The history of beards has been a topic of increasing curiosity in today’s society. Early man first cherished a beard for religious reasons; primitive races were convinced there was a sacred connection between all parts of a man’s body, including his hair, and his personality. Hence, hair had to be carefully guarded from possible foes—this accounts for ancient man’s custom of burning hair clippings to prevent them from being used by his enemies for nefarious purposes. Thus, the earliest beard was faith-conditioned and therefore meticulously cared for. Ancient Egyptians used tongs, curling irons, dyes, and even gold dust to give it a golden sheen. In those days, shaving was considered perverted. It was a practice reserved for the defeated adversary and the dangerously diseased; lepers were shaved to warn others of their infection. Sometimes those in mourning also shaved as a symbol of vital sacrifice to the dead. The whims of individual rulers contributed to in determining the fate of beards. For example, Queen Elizabeth I, who disliked beards, taxed anyone sprouting a beard of more than two weeks’ growth—the amount of assessment depended upon the man’s social standing. In France, the beard became fashionable when it was the personal preference of the current king. Francis I grew a beard to hide an ugly scar on his chin, and his male subjects emulated the fashion. During the eighteenth century, the Spaniards considered the beard to be in poor taste because their king was unable to grow one."
